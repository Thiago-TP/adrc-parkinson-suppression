## Submitting a pull request

We encourage an issue-driven approach for submitting pull requests.

0. Open an issue (bug or report) using the appropriate template
0. Clone the repository
0. Create a new branch linked to the opened issue
0. Commit your change, making sure the code works as intended
0. Push to your remote branch and submit a pull request
0. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style guide agreed on for the project.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
